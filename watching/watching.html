                                        answer. He said to him: “Abu has summed up the story.”
                                        The worldly tyrant in six verses: “We come to the world as equals, the child of
                                        kings as
                                        the child of courtiers.”
                                        And we leave this world, as you can see, standing together on bare graves. Our

                                    <p>The second story:
                                        One day there was a parents' meeting in a school, and among the attendees was a
                                        teacher
                                        who had spent many years of her life studying and learning the teachings of her
                                        true
                                        religion. She gave a few few words.
                                        Which was very valuable and expressive for parents...
                                        We should all know...that our master Noah, peace be upon him, did not fail in
                                        raising
                                        his son or calling him to worship God.
                                        He is alone and has no partner. He was a prophet.He had no way to imprint
                                        disbelief on
                                        his son's heart. And Azer, the father of our master
                                        “Abraham,” peace be upon him, did not strive to raise his son and reform him to
                                        be a
                                        messenger and prophet. And our master “Jacob,” peace be upon him, did not plant
                                        in the
                                        hearts of his children jealousy, envy, hatred, and hatred toward their little

                                        “Joseph,” peace be upon him, to the point that they wanted to kill him and get
                                        rid of
                                        him permanently...</p>

                                    <p>National Geographic conducted a very wonderful experiment. They conducted an
                                        experiment
                                        on two monkeys and placed them in...
                                        Two cages next to each other so that they could see each other, and on the first
                                        day the
                                        keeper gave each monkey one of them
                                        A small pebble, and then the guard asks the monkey to retrieve the small pebble
                                        and once
                                        the monkey returns it
                                        He gets a reward from the guard.He did this with the first monkey, and the
                                        monkey
                                        succeeded in returning the small pebble to the guard, who gave him a piece
                                        From the cucumber as a reward, the monkey started dancing because he was so
                                        happy with
                                        the piece of cucumber and he was enjoying and enjoying eating it.
                                        As for the second monkey, the guard gave him a bunch of delicious red grapes as
                                        a reward
                                        When he retrieved the small pebble from him, the first monkey was then observing
                                        the
                                        entire situation...</p>

                                        <p>On the second day, the same experiment was repeated, when the guard gave the
                                            first
                                            monkey a small pebble
                                            He asked him to take it back. The monkey returned it to him, but when the
                                            guard gave
                                            him a piece of cucumber as a reward, he got up
                                            The monkey threw it in his face; Once again, the guard gave the second
                                            monkey a
                                            bunch of red grapes
                                            As a reward for returning the pebble, the first monkey watches carefully.

                                            On the third day, the same experiment was repeated. The first monkey threw
                                            the small
                                            pebble at him
                                            The guard without expecting a reward from him in the first place, and again
                                            the
                                            guard gave the second monkey a bunch
                                            Grapes as a bonus!</p>

                                        it,
                                        father?” He said to him: “Omar,” may God be pleased with him.
                                        He satisfied him: “I should be buried next to the Messenger of God. My son, go
                                        to Aisha,

                                        <p>Our master “Abdullah” returned to his father and said with joy: (O Father,

                                            of the Believers has given you permission), and behold,

                                            He saw his father's cheek on the dirt, so he approached him and sat next to

                                            put his father's cheek on his thigh, so he looked at him.
                                            Our master “Omar” said to him: (Why did you keep my cheek from the dirt?!),
                                            “Abdullah” said: (Oh father), so he said

                                            Our master, “Omar bin Al-Khattab,” may God be pleased with him, died after
                                            he made a

                                            He said it
                                            To him: (If you carry me and pray for me in the mosque of the Messenger of
                                            God, then
                                            look at the rows of worshippers, and if you see “Hudhayfah”

                                            He will be careful with me in saying, so if Hudhayfah prays over me, then
                                            carry me
                                            towards the house of the Messenger of God. Then stand on
                                            The door and say, “Mother, your son is Omar,” and do not say “Commander of

                                            Faithful,” for you may be ashamed of me
                                            So I gave permission
                                            For me, if you do not give me permission, then bury me in the Muslim

                                            So his son “Abdullah” carried him, and when he found our master “Hudhayfah

                                            And carry it

                                            Our master Omar bin Al-Khattab was buried next to his two friends. Our

                                            He pleased him, he filled the earth with justice, and despite the fact that

                                            Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, gave him good

                                            That he is
                                            One of the companions of Paradise, except that he feared God intensely and
                                            feared
                                            His torment. What about us?
                                            today?!
                                            We were protected from the punishment of God, and we became dependent on the
                                            life of
                                            this world, so we began to have fun, play, and laugh, not knowing if it was

                                    <p>The cunning fox There was a large forest, and there was a lion in it that
                                        frightened and
                                        harmed the animals, so they gathered The animals of the forest decided to
                                        cooperate
                                        together and confront the lion’s brutality and harm, and they came up with a
                                        smart plan
                                        to trap him. In a cage, their smart plan succeeded. They trapped the lion and
                                        lived
                                        happily and safely. And one day Once a little rabbit passed by the cage in which
                                        the
                                        lion was confined, and the lion said to the rabbit: “Please, rabbit.” الصغير أن
                                        تساعدني
                                        I have to get out of this cage.” The rabbit replied: “No, I will never let you
                                        out
                                        You torture animals and eat them.” The lion said, “I promise you that I will not
                                        return
                                        to these actions, and I will become a friend.”
                                        For all the animals, and I will not harm any of them.” The good little rabbit
                                        believed
                                        the lion’s words and opened to him </p>

                                        <p></p>He opened the cage door and helped him get out. As soon as the lion came
                                        out, he
                                        jumped on the rabbit and grabbed him, then he said: "You
                                        My first prey for today!” The rabbit started screaming and crying for help in
                                        panic, and
                                        there it was
                                        fox
                                        A smart man was close to them, so he heard the rabbit’s cries for help and ran
                                        quickly
                                        to help him, and when he arrived, he went to
                                        the lion
                                        He spoke to him, saying: “I heard that you were locked in this cage. Is that
                                        so?”
                                        TRUE Really?” The lion said: “Yes, the animals locked me in it.” The fox
                                        replied: “But I
                                        don’t
                                        believe
                                        So, how can a big and mighty lion like you fit inside this small cage? It seems
                                        you are
                                        lying
                                        Ali.” The lion replied: “I am not lying, and I will prove to you that I was
                                        inside this
                                        cage.” The lion entered the cage.
                                        Once again, in order to prove to the fox that he had room inside him, the fox
                                        quickly
                                        approached the cage door
                                        He closed it tightly, trapped the lion in it again, and then said to the rabbit:
                                        “Don’t
                                        believe this lion
                                        once again" . </p>

                                        and a
                                        little mouse climbed onto his back and started
                                        While playing, the lion felt disturbed by the movement on his back and woke up
                                        angry, so
                                        he grabbed the mouse and decided to...
                                        He ate it directly. The mouse was very frightened and began to apologize to the

                                        disturbing him, and begged him to release him or not
                                        He ate him, then promised to save him one day if he freed him. The lion laughed
                                        sarcastically, so how could a little mouse help?

                                            To put it in it, the mouse saw the lion in this state and remembered his
                                            promise to
                                            him, so he approached him and began to bite
                                            He cut the ropes, and the lion was able to escape and get away from the
                                            hunters. The
                                            mouse looked at the lion and said
                                            To him: “Didn’t I tell you that I would save you one day?” The lion
                                            regretted his
                                            belittling and mockery of the mouse, and thanked him
                                            So much for saving him.</p>

                                    <h2>the fourth story</h2>
                                    <p>A bird and an elephant in a distant forest full of large, beautiful trees, and
                                        many
                                        animals
                                        And various, a little bird lived with its mother and siblings in a small nest
                                        built on
                                        the tops of a tree.
                                        One day, the bird went to the mother to search for food for her young children
                                        who had
                                        no food
                                        They can fly, and while she was away from the nest, a strong wind blew and shook
                                        the
                                        nest, and the little bird fell
                                        On the ground. The little bird had not yet learned to fly, so it remained in its
                                        place,
                                        frightened, waiting for it to return
                                        His mother, and during that time, a good elephant passed by, walking cheerfully
                                        in the
                                        forest, hitting the ground with his big feet.And singing loudly, the bird was
                                        frightened
                                        It was intense, and he started trying to hide from the elephant, but...
                                        The elephant saw him and said to him: “Are you okay, beautiful little bird? Did
                                        you fall
                                        from the tree?” But
                                        The bird was very afraid and could not answer the elephant. It was shivering
                                        greatly
                                        from fear and cold, so it became sad.
                                        The elephant decided to bring some leaves and put them around him to keep him
                                        warm. A
                                        cunning fox came and saw the elephant
                                        He talks to the bird and then goes away to bring him the papers. He approached
                                        the bird
                                        when the elephant was gone.
                                        The little bird that he fell from
                                        Nest, the fox said cunningly: “I know where your nest is, bird, and I will
                                        return you to
                                        it, but you must...
                                        The beginning is to get rid of the elephant, as it is an evil animal and wants
                                        to harm
                                        you.” At this moment, the elephant came back carrying
                                        Leaves, so the fox moved away and hid behind the trees watching the bird. The
                                        elephant
                                        placed the leaves around the bird.
                                        And who felt</p>
                                    <div class="content-r">
                                        <p>With warmth, then he said to the elephant: “Oh good elephant, I feel hungry.
                                            Can you
                                            bring me some
                                            Food?” This was the bird’s idea to keep the elephant away from him so that
                                            the fox
                                            could return him to his nest
                                            And his brothers, the elephant is big and very scary, but the fox looks good
                                            and has
                                            beautiful fur.
                                            With wonderful colors, the elephant replied: “Sure, bird, I will bring you
                                            some
                                            grains, but be patient
                                            Be careful of other animals and do not move from your place until I return.”
                                            The fox
                                            approached the bird at
                                            The elephant went and said to him: "Let's go, so I can return you to your
                                            nest,
                                            bird." He carried him and moved away behind him الشجرة، وفجأة تغيرت ملامح
                                            الثعلب،
                                            ورمى العصفور على الأرض ثمّ هجم عليه لافتراسه
                                            As he ate it, the bird began to scream loudly: “Save me! Please save me!”
                                            The
                                            elephant heard the bird's voice
                                            He quickly returned and saw the fox trying to prey on the bird, so he ran
                                            quickly
                                            and hit the fox, which fled
                                            Walking away, the elephant picked up the bird and said to him: “Didn’t I
                                            tell you
                                            not to go away, bird?” I confess
                                            The bird: “Actually, I was afraid of you, elephant. You are big, huge, and
                                            huge.
                                            And I am a very small bird.” The elephant replied with great sadness: “Bird,
                                            I do
                                            not eat animals.”
                                            Little one, I only want to help you, and you must learn that no one should
                                            be judged
                                            by... By its shape or size, but only by its actions.” Then the elephant took
                                            the
                                            bird and returned it to the tree that had fallen
                                            From her, and his mother was looking for him with great fear, so she was
                                            very happy
                                            when she saw him, and thanked the elephant for his help
                                            for him
                                        </p>

                                    <p>The Fox and the Grapes There was a little fox walking in the forest, and suddenly
                                        he saw
                                        a bunch of grapes hanging from the tree.
                                        one of the high branches, and he said: “This is what I needed to quench my
                                        thirst,” the
                                        fox said to himself happily, then
                                        He took a few steps back and jumped, trying to catch the cluster, but he failed,
                                        so he
                                        tried a second and third time.
                                        He continued trying to no avail, and finally, after losing hope, the fox walked
                                        away
                                        from the tree.
                                        He says arrogantly: “They are fruits</p>

                                        <p>Sour anyway...I don't want it anymore!” The moral of the story is that it's
                                            very
                                            easy to criticize something

                                        And all its fruits were constantly eaten, and some of its branches were broken
                                        every day
                                        because all the animals

                                        <p>And one day some men went to the garden, and saw the two trees carefully, and
                                            then
                                            they found that the tree
                                            The quiet one had no fruit in it, and the ground is dirty, and the branches
                                            are
                                            broken, and all kinds of things live on it.
                                            the animals, but the selfish tree is full of ripe fruit, its ground is
                                            clean, and
                                            its branches are strong
                                            And no animals live on it.

                                            And the selfish tree tried to show the men that it was better than the other
                                            tree,
                                            which was on
                                            Her calm nature as usual.
                                            And the men immediately decided that they would cut down the selfish tree
                                            because it
                                            could be sold for more than
                                            The quiet tree, which has no fruit to eat, and no strong branches to use for
                                            making the furniture.

                                            In addition, the quiet tree is inhabited by many animals and birds, and the
                                            men did
                                            not like it
                                            taking them out of their homes.

                                        healthy
                                        body, as the story revolves around a child
                                        A seven-year-old boy named Ali. Ali loved sports and went to the club to play
                                        football.
                                        But he did not like healthy food and did not listen to his mother, who always
                                        advised
                                        him to eat chicken
                                        Meat, vegetables, and fruits. All the time, he wanted to drink sweetened juices

                                            against another club
                                            He prepared very well and went to the match and started playing and was very
                                            skilled, but he fell in the middle
                                            The match broke his legs, so he went to the doctor and put a cast on him,
                                            and after
                                            tests it was revealed that he had osteoporosis
                                            His muscles became weak and tender, and the doctor prevented him from
                                            playing
                                            football until his health completely improved, after a while

                                            led to him

                                        Hazem were
                                        playing with each other in a courtyard.
                                        School and they go home together every day after school, and one day after
                                        Hazem and Atef left school. Atef went to the candy cart to buy candy as he used
                                        to do
                                        every day, but...
                                        Hazem tried to stop him and told him, Atef, we should not eat such foods, as
                                        they are
                                        unhealthy for me
                                        Absolutely, and it harms us. Yesterday, I heard the doctor on television talking
                                        about
                                        the value of eliminating healthy foods and the harm of sweet foods

                                        <p>Atef rejected these words and told him no, as everyone eats uncovered sweets,

                                            are cheap and delicious
                                            The taste is beautiful and delicious. I will eat it, but you are free. I

                                            you eat it against your will.
                                            Indeed, Atef went to the cart and bought the colorful sweets that looked
                                            very
                                            bright, and ate them
                                            Immediately, he kept saying to his friend, “Didn’t I tell you that it is
                                            delicious

                                            Before arriving home, Atef felt severe pain in his stomach and screamed

                                    <h2>the first story</h2>
                                    <p>The story of the people of Paradise: There was a man from the people of Yemen who
                                        owned a
                                        garden in which there were various kinds of fruits, and this was this
                                        During the harvest season, a man does not eat any of his produce before
                                        distributing
                                        part of it to the poor
                                        He gave charity to those in need, and he enjoyed the blessings of his charity
                                        and the
                                        goodness that he provided to people.[1] And when I came,
                                        On the death of this generous man, he advised his children to continue giving
                                        alms to
                                        the poor and needy.
                                        The blessing and continuity of money comes from these actions. </p>

                                        <p>But his children did not implement their father’s will, and they agreed to
                                            prevent
                                            the poor from giving alms, thinking that
                                            Giving alms to the poor and feeding them reduces the harvest, and they are
                                            the ones
                                            who are tired of farming
                                            And the harvest, while those poor people do nothing for them, then they do
                                            not
                                            deserve anything from
                                            The crop.[1]>And on the night of the harvest, after they had made the
                                            intention to
                                            harvest the orchard before it came to them.
                                            The poor do not even give them
                                            Something, they woke up and rushed to the orchard to harvest it, but they
                                            were
                                            surprised that their orchard looked like fire.
                                            I burned it
                                        </p>

                                    <p>The story of the owners of the elephant: There was a king in Abyssinia called
                                        Abha
                                        al-Ashram, and he wanted to build a church to visit
                                        People make the pilgrimage to it just as the Arabs make the pilgrimage to the
                                        Holy
                                        Kaaba. When the Arabs heard about this house, they took it
                                        Glory, how can a house other than the Kaaba be intended for worship, so one of
                                        them went
                                        to the church of Abraha and placed in it
                                        He left his waste and fled. When the news reached Abraha, he became extremely
                                        angry and
                                        said that no one would do this act except
                                        Arabs, so he decided to demolish the Holy Kaaba.[2] He prepared a great army and
                                        sent
                                        elephants with them until they rose</p>

                                            that
                                            whenever they directed him to a place, he would go to it, except for the
                                            Kaaba
                                            He will lie down in his place, and this is from God Almighty’s protection of
                                            his
                                            Sacred House.[2] And they continued to do so until he was resurrected
                                            God bless them with birds loaded with flaming stones, and each of them was
                                            carrying
                                            a stone in
                                            His beak and two stones in his hands, and as soon as one of them was thrown
                                            at a
                                            group of them, he would die immediately, as a punishment for what he had
                                            done.
                                            They did it.[2]

                                        Al-Khattab - may God be pleased with him - as he used to forbid
                                        About mixing milk with water, and one day he was checking the conditions of the
                                        city at
                                        night when he heard a woman saying
                                        To her daughter, mix the milk in the water, so the Commander of the Faithful
                                        will not
                                        know what we are doing. Her daughter said to her: Oh mother

                                        The girl and her morals, then he went home and told his son</p>
